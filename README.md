# Description
A sample scenario that involves 
- Software you probably have never used before.  
- debugging a service using tools and languages you are not familiar with.  

## Scenario
Postfix is dropping emails to user batman@pathfinder.gr with message: `550 User Inactive`.  
This message is generated by the mailreflector service.  
Investigate, try to see how this service works, and enable emails for this user.

## Requirements
In order to run this, you will need
- Linux
- Docker
- Docker-compose

## HOWTO
### Fetch:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rkrambovitis/operator_search.git
```

### Start the service(s)
```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Test
In a new terminal:
```bash
./test.sh phaistos_robert@pathfinder.gr
```

### Explore
Have fun. Play around. Try to follow how it works, what it does,    
and figure out what needs to be done.  

### Demonstrate
When you feel you have progressed enough, either because you solved it, found it easy,  
or because you got stuck and need guidance, seek out Mark, Gabriel or Robert.
